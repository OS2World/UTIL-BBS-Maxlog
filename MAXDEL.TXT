MAXDEL is a very simple program used to purge individual file names from
the MAXLOG.DAT file.  The program will accept up to 10 file names on the
command line. These file names will be deleted from the log.

MAXDEL does NOT accept wildcards.  (sorry, please send wildcard parsing code.)

For example, to delete all .QWK mail packets from the OS2 Shareware BBS
data file, I would enter:

MAXDEL OS2SHARE.QWK OS2SHARE.QW1 OS2SHARE.QW2 OS2SHARE.QW3

The program is useful for cleaning out files which you don't want to
have in your counts and bulletins.
