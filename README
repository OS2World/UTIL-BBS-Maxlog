This update to Maxlog (1.32) includes a few minor fixes and enhancements.

It now ignores all files with ".qw?" extentions to eliminate the .QWK
packets from the counts and bulletins.  It also ignores all files with
.TIC extentions.

There is a bug fix for a problem created when the total number of different
files in the data file exceeded 3000.

Another bug fix is in here for a problem when the total number of bytes
downloaded during the summary period exceeds 2 gigabytes.
